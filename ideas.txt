convert wikipedia language dump for language X into IPA
then learn distributions for IPA
this way we can use arabic, etc.

but still need to generate a spelling system somehow...
in fiction spelling conventions do a lot of the work of giving a feel for the "culture"
perhaps have a database of existsing spelling systems and do combinations to generate a new one
maybe some minimal/rare innovation can be allowed




hmm:
is there a difference between generating words forwards vs in reverse vs outwards?



generate a distribution for english, one for french, etc.
then take convex combinations of the distributions to generate a language


figure out nouns, verbs, adj, proper names, etc to generate a distribution for each. then you get a generator for each



once you've generated a language, generate words to go with all english stems
then generate morphology (study morphology to learn how to do this?)
and generate some syntax rules (e.g. SVO vs VSO etc, and all kinds of parameters derived from xbar theory)
then for any given english sentence, you could write its translation in the generated language

hmm, you could also use word embeddings somehow? generate a word embedding? use word embedding to generate morphology? idk...
