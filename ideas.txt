convert wikipedia language dump for language X into IPA
then learn distributions for IPA
this way we can use arabic, etc.

but still need to generate a spelling system somehow...
in fiction spelling conventions do a lot of the work of giving a feel for the "culture"
perhaps have a database of existsing spelling systems and do combinations to generate a new one
maybe some minimal/rare innovation can be allowed




hmm:
is there a difference between generating words forwards vs in reverse vs outwards?



generate a distribution for english, one for french, etc.
then take convex combinations of the distributions to generate a language
